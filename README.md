# Talk To ChatGPT

This is a simple web app that allows you to talk to a chatbot powered by [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/). 
It is built using [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/).

I'm using `react-speech-recognition` to get the speech input and `SpeechSynthesisUtterance` to convert the text to speech.
